# My expense
a.k.a. _Where the hell is my money?!_

# Why?
From time to everyone wonders where did all the money go.
 
Few years ago I created myself quite nice spreadsheet that totally did the job. 
It had what I needed back then, but it was troublesome to fill and with time hard to extend with new features. 
I completely dropped it early 2020 and surprise, surprise - I don't know now where the hell is my money :(

# There's an app for that!
Dozens!

In late December 2020 I installed 8 apps on my mobile and sadly, really sadly, none of them filled my needs. 
And those are quite simple I'd say... 

# MVP
* Add expenses with ease. Each consists of:
    * Date
    * Place
    * Items. Each consists of:
        * Category
        * Price
* See expenses breakdown by:
    * Date range
    * Category
    * Place
* Django admin interface, because I have no time for frontend 
    
# Future plans
* ability to read receipt image (OCR / AI / other)
* Web frontend
* Maybe mobile?
